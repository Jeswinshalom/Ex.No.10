**Name:** Jeswin Shalom S  
**Reg.No.:** 212223060106  
## Objective
Demonstrate how different prompting techniques—such as query decomposition, decision-making, semantic filtering, and more—can be applied to generate high-quality content like reports, articles, case studies, and creative works (e.g., comic books) using AI models like ChatGPT.

>  Goal: Showcase how prompt structure directly affects the **quality**, **coherence**, and **depth** of AI-generated content.

##  Prompting Techniques Overview

| Technique             | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Query Decomposition   | Break a complex prompt into smaller sub-questions for clarity and detail.   |
| Decision-Making       | Let the model weigh options and justify decisions to simulate analysis.     |
| Semantic Filtering    | Add constraints (keywords, tone, audience) to steer the content.            |
| Role Prompting        | Assign the model a persona to match tone and style for specific audiences.  |
| Chain-of-Thought (CoT)| Guide the model to reason step-by-step before generating full output.       |
| Iterative Refinement  | Revise and improve content through successive prompts and edits.            |

## Example Use Case: *Smart Irrigation System (Case Study)*

### 1. 🔹 Basic Prompt
> **Prompt:**  
Write a case study about a smart irrigation system using IoT.

**Result:**  
Flat structure, general information, lacks specific detail.

---

### 2.  Query Decomposition
> **Sub-prompts:**
- What are traditional irrigation challenges?
- How does a smart irrigation system work?
- What technologies (sensors, cloud, Arduino) are used?
- Describe a real-life farm implementation.
- What were the results and benefits?

**Result:**  
Structured and detailed content with clearer sections.

---

### 3.  Semantic Filtering
> **Prompt:**  
Write a technical case study for agricultural engineers. Use terms like *soil moisture sensor*, *automated control*, and *cloud analytics*. Keep the tone formal and informative.

**Result:**  
Precise, jargon-aware, domain-relevant content.

---

### 4.  Role Prompting
> **Prompt:**  
You are a journalist for *AgriTech Weekly*. Write a feature on a smart irrigation system using IoT, including quotes from farmers and experts.

**Result:**  
Narrative tone, includes anecdotal evidence and voice.

---

### 5. ⚖️ Decision-Making
> **Prompt:**  
Compare sensor-based and weather-based smart irrigation systems. Choose the better approach and justify your decision in a case study format.

**Result:**  
Analytical content with evaluation and recommendation.

---

### 6.  Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting
> **Prompt:**  
List the components of a smart irrigation system first. Then describe how they work together. Conclude with their impact on water usage and crop yield.

**Result:**  
Stepwise reasoning with structured, logical flow.

---

### 7. 🛠 Iterative Refinement
> **Steps:**
1. Generate a rough draft.  
2. Refine technical explanation of components.  
3. Add real-world stats from India.  
4. Improve tone and formatting for publication.

**Result:**  
Highly polished, deeply informative final product.

##  Bonus: Creative Content Use Case

### Prompt:
Create a comic book storyline where kids time-travel to learn about renewable energy. Use simple language, fun characters, and include concepts like solar, wind, and geothermal power.

**Techniques Applied:**
-  Role Prompting (targeting kids)
-  Semantic Filtering (specific energy concepts)
-  Chain-of-Thought (scene-by-scene logic)

| 1    | Generate basic case study           | Simple Prompt          |
| 2    | Add structure via sub-questions     | Query Decomposition    |
| 3    | Filter with audience + keywords     | Semantic Filtering     |
| 4    | Add voice/tone by assigning a role  | Role Prompting         |
| 5    | Guide step-by-step thinking         | Chain-of-Thought       |
| 6    | Improve language and logic          | Iterative Refinement   |
| 7    | Compare all outputs                 | Evaluation             |
